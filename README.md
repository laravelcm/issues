# Jobs Portail Issue Tracker
This is where we keep track of all bugs and feature requests for the [Laravel Cameroun Jobs Portail](https://jobs.laravel.cm). If you want to be able to test the features in advance and have an idea of what will happen, you can look at the site staging [jobs-staging.laravel.cm](https://jobs-staging.laravel.cm) which will have the latest features that will be tested and deployed on the official site. If you see any bugs or suggestions don't hesitate to create an issue or report a bug. Or even make a suggestion on the **[Discussions](https://github.com/laravelcm/jobs-portail-issues/discussions)** section.

> Please note the issue tracker is not for technical support questions.

If you have any questions on topics such as project vision, vision, or even technical or legal questions, we recommend joining the Laravel Cameroun Discord or Slack community and asking your question to the group:
